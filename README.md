# CharityChain

### 🌍 Project Description
**CharityChain** is a decentralized donation platform built on the Ethereum blockchain.  
It enables users to create fundraising campaigns and allows donors to contribute transparently using smart contracts — ensuring that all donations are publicly verifiable and reach their intended recipients directly.

---

### 🚀 Project Vision
To build a **trustless, transparent, and global** ecosystem for charitable giving — eliminating intermediaries and maximizing the impact of every donation through blockchain accountability.

---

### ✨ Key Features
- **Create Campaigns:** Any user can start a fundraising campaign with a title, description, and funding goal.  
- **Transparent Donations:** Donors can view and contribute directly to campaigns on-chain.  
- **Automatic Completion:** When a campaign reaches its goal, funds are automatically transferred to the creator.  
- **Public Record:** All transactions and donations are permanently stored on the blockchain.

---

### 🔮 Future Scope
- Add **NFT badges** for donors as proof of contribution.  
- Integrate with **IPFS** for decentralized campaign descriptions and images.  
- Introduce a **DAO governance system** for community-driven campaign verification.  
- Multi-chain support across **Polygon**, **Base**, and **Arbitrum** for lower gas fees.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Solidity** (Smart Contract)  
- **Ethereum / EVM-compatible networks**  
- **Hardhat** (Development Framework)  
- **Metamask** (Wallet Integration)
